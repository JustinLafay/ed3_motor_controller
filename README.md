# ED3 Motor controller
Project for controlling an electric motor with H bridge and LPC1769 microcontroller. 
## Project submission file
All the project is explained in the project submission file.
## UART Codes
They are 2 UART codes, one is in .exe format and the other in .py format.
The objective of those 2 codes are the same : transmit data of speed and rotation direction of the DC electric motor to the LPC1769.
### exe/.py code
You need to enter :
- The COM port (for example ```COM9```)
- The way of direction (for example ```0```)
- The speed (for example ```2000```)
- To exit you can just type in 'exit' (in .py) or 'SALIR' (in .exe)
